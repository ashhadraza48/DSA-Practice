#Problem1: Search X in sorted array
Given a sorted array of integers nums with 0-based indexing, find the index of a specified target integer. If the target is found in the array, return its index. If the target is not found, return -1.
Example:
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9

Output: 4


-----------------------------------------------------
#Problem2: Lower Bound
Given a sorted array of nums and an integer x, write a program to find the lower bound of x.
The lower bound algorithm finds the first and smallest index in a sorted array where the value at that index is greater than or equal to a given key i.e. x.
If no such index is found, return the size of the array.

Example:
Input : nums= [1,2,2,3], x = 2

Output:1


-----------------------------------------------------
#Problem3: Upper Bound
Given a sorted array of nums and an integer x, write a program to find the upper bound of x.
The upper bound of x is defined as the smallest index i such that nums[i] > x.
If no such index is found, return the size of the array.

Example:
Input : n= 4, nums = [1,2,2,3], x = 2

Output:3


-----------------------------------------------------
#Problem4: Search insert position
Given a sorted array of nums consisting of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

Example:
Input: nums = [1, 3, 5, 6], target = 5

Output: 2


-----------------------------------------------------
#Problem5: Floor and Ceil in Sorted Array
Given a sorted array nums and an integer x. Find the floor and ceil of x in nums. The floor of x is the largest element in the array which is smaller than or equal to x. The ceiling of x is the smallest element in the array greater than or equal to x. If no floor or ceil exists, output -1.

Example:
Input : nums =[3, 4, 4, 7, 8, 10], x= 5

Output: 4 7	


-----------------------------------------------------
#Problem6: First and last occurrence
Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value. If the target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

Example:
Input: nums = [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10], target = 8

Output: [3, 4]
